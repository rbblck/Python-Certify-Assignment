## How to play Spoons card game ##
The card game, Spoons, is named for the utensil each player is trying to win a chance to grab, as well as the word everyone is trying not to spell. Do the rules sound confusing? They really arenâ€™t.
Spoons can be played with up to 8 people. Players take turns trying to collect four-of-a-kind and once someone does, they grab a spoon.
## The Pack ##
A standard deck of cards (no Jokers)Spoons, one less than the number of players. If you have 5 players, you would need 4 spoons2 to 8 players
## What are Spoons rules? ##
Start the game by arranging all the spoons in the middle of the table. Then the dealer may deal four cards to each player. The dealer should keep the remaining cards in a pile on the table.
At the beginning of each round, the dealer takes a card off the top of the deck (to have five cards in his hand), he or she then removes one card from their hand and passes it to the player on their left. This continues around the circle of players with each player taking a card from the last person, chooses whether to keep it and passes one card on to the next player. Each player discards to the next person.
The last player places his discarded card into a discard pile and the next round begins when the dealer picks up a new card. If at any time the draw cards run out, pause to reshuffle the trash pile and keep going.
Play continues quickly until someone gets four of a kind. At that time, the player takes a spoon from the centre.
## How to keep score ##
The winner is the player with the most spoons in his / hers possession.
